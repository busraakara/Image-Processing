# Image-Processing

In this repository, i created 2 folders. One of them mostly consists of the algorithms I developed for the Digital Image Processing Category of the Teknofest 2023 Chip Design Competition, where we came in 3rd together with our team SUBU VLSI. The other one consists of a compilation for those who are just starting to learn OpenCV or want to use it as a look up table.
